Things to be done!

TODO before v2.0 is released:

-See if it's okay to release with the current Cemetech support.
-Do something about newlines in file descriptions.
	(Decide what to do)
-What is the best way to present inline images in Omnimaga files descriptions?
-Rewrite the INSTALL documentation (and the README, probably).
-More, possibly.
