Things to be done!

TODO before v2.0 is released:

-See if it's okay to release with the current Cemetech support.
-Do something about newlines in file descriptions.
	(Decide what to do)
-What is the best way to present inline images in Omnimaga files descriptions?
-Rewrite the INSTALL documentation (and the README, probably).
-Figure out how best to format the output from the list command

-More, possibly.

TODO, in the long term:

-Rewrite the index sorting code (this is dangerous, but that code is really old and terrible...)
-The redirectable output hack works, but it would probably be a better idea to use something like logging.
